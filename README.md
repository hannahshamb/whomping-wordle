# Whomping Wordle

<h3> So you think you are some kind of Auror, do you? 
</br> Try to snatch this wizard if you can... ⚡️
</h3>
A full stack JavaScript game project where players can guess <strong>the Harry Potter wizard of the day.</strong> 
</br> Users select from a dropdown menu of Harry Potter characters and receive color-coded blocks across different categories that show the user what aspects of their guesses are correct or incorrect. 

## Why I built this application

I have always loved puzzles, brain games like wordle, and <strike>never received my acceptance letter to Hogwarts</strike> grew up loving the Harry Potter series. When I found an API with detailed Harry Potter character data, I saw an opportunity to design a fun brain game for the Harry Potter fandom.
